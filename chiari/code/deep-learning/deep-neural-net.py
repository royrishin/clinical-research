# In search of the classification ML model that was trained as part of this research that gave potentially positive results from the tests.

Through further studies I am finding it would be better to use AI driven approach to use deep learning model to detect the chiari malformation in the images. 
It seems in the above research program deep learning neural net CNN (concolutional neural network) model was trained with classification technique on MRI scan images to assist clinicians in disgnosis & decision making of chari malfunction. 
Results captured are as below:

Results
The VGG19 model (VGG19 is a 19-layer deep convolutional neural network architecture that is widely used in computer vision tasks like image classification, feature extraction, and neural style transfer) with data 
augmentation achieved a sensitivity of 97.1% and a specificity of 97.4% with an AUC of 0.99. The ResNet50 (convolutional neural network (CNN) that excels at image classification) model achieved a sensitivity of 94.0% and a specificity of 94.4% with an AUC of 0.98.
